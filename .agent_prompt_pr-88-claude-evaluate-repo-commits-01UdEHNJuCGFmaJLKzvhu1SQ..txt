Task: Update PR #88 (branch claude/evaluate-repo-commits-01UdEHNJuCGFmaJLKzvhu1SQ) in jleechanorg/mcp_mail, finish the pending changes, and push. Workdir: /private/tmp/mcp_mail/pr-88-claude-evaluate-repo-commits-01UdEHNJuCGFmaJLKzvhu1SQ.

Checkout rule:
- If `gh pr checkout 88` fails because the branch is already checked out, create a fresh worktree and use it:
  git worktree add /private/tmp/mcp_mail/pr-88-rerun claude/evaluate-repo-commits-01UdEHNJuCGFmaJLKzvhu1SQ
  cd /private/tmp/mcp_mail/pr-88-rerun

Process:
1) Checkout PR: gh pr checkout 88 (or use worktree fallback above); fetch GH status: gh pr view 88 --json statusCheckRollup,mergeable,mergeStateStatus.
2) Inspect current diffs (git status/git diff) and continue rather than discarding.
3) When editing, read the target file first. If apply_patch/replace fails twice ("old_string not found"), switch to manual editing; do NOT loop.
4) Run a fast test pass: python -m pytest (or the project’s quickest targeted suite). If you must skip due to time/infra, note it explicitly.
5) Keep changes minimal and PR-scoped; remove temp .mcp_mail/projects/test-instrumented-* artifacts before committing unless needed.
6) Commit with prefix [gemini-automation-commit] and push to the PR branch.

Rules:
- No subagents. No endless retries. If blocked by missing context/creds, stop and log the reason.
- Summarize what failed, what you changed, and what you tested in the completion report.

Exit criteria:
- Tests run or explicitly skipped with rationale.
- Temp artifacts cleaned (unless required).
- Changes committed and pushed to PR #88.
- Completion report written to /tmp/orchestration_results/pr-88-claude-evaluate-repo-commits-01UdEHNJuCGFmaJLKzvhu1SQ._results.json
