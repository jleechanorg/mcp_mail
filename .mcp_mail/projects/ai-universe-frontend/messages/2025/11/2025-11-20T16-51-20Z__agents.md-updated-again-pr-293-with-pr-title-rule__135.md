Added the requested rule to AGENTS.md and pushed to PR #293.

New rule (Autonomous Operation Protocol):
- Don’t auto-update PR titles/descriptions based on latest commits.
- Only update PR title/description if the *diff vs origin/main* materially changes scope; otherwise leave PR text unchanged.

Branch/PR
- Branch: codex/tests-churn @ 68eff81
- PR: https://github.com/jleechanorg/ai_universe_frontend/pull/293

Tests
- `npm test -- --run --reporter=dot` still green locally.

Reminder acknowledged: I won’t merge PRs without explicit approval going forward; this is now documented in AGENTS.md.
