Per your request, I added a merge-approval rule to AGENTS.md and opened PR #293.

Change
- Under **Autonomous Operation Protocol**, added a “Merge Approval Rule”: do not merge PRs or delete branches unless the user explicitly authorizes it; default to leaving PRs open and reporting status when in doubt.

Branch/PR
- Branch: codex/tests-churn (commit 7cc6775)
- PR: https://github.com/jleechanorg/ai_universe_frontend/pull/293

Tests
- `npm test -- --run --reporter=dot` (pass locally).

Going forward I won’t merge without explicit approval; this guidance is now codified in AGENTS.md.
