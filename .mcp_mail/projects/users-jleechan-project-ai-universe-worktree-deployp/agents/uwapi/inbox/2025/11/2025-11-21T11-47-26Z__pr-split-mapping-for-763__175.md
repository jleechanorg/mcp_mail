Here’s the current bead ↔ PR mapping for the #763 split:

- deployp-22l → PR #794 https://github.com/jleechanorg/ai_universe/pull/794
- deployp-t44 → PR #774 https://github.com/jleechanorg/ai_universe/pull/774
- deployp-rbo → PR #775 https://github.com/jleechanorg/ai_universe/pull/775
- deployp-9f7 → PR #777 https://github.com/jleechanorg/ai_universe/pull/777
- deployp-2hc → no dedicated PR in the open list yet
- deployp-5am → coordination task only (no PR)

If any PR numbers shift, I’ll resend an updated map.
