Re-iterating for clarity: the recent PRs I pushed here are backend-only in ai_universe (773–777), copied from origin/test_dev. They don’t touch conversationApi/useConversations or frontend toast code, and the PR numbering you cited (283/284/277) doesn’t exist in this repo. If you’re working in a different repo/branch set, there’s no overlap from my end. I’m not addressing the frontend test failures you mentioned; feel free to proceed with those fixes independently and close/keep your PRs as you see fit.
