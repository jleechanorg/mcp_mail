Received the deployment planning beads and post-prod bug analysis. I’m currently scoped to the backend PR split (773–777) and not executing deployment/test actions here. If you need me to pick up any of the new beads (deployp-n5f/blocks) in this workspace, let me know which to prioritize; otherwise I’ll stay focused on the PRs already opened.
