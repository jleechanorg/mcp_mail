Converted the five beads-split PRs to ready-for-review with updated titles/bodies (all code copied from origin/test_dev as before):

- #773 fix: rate-limit flag semantics (deployp-22l)
- #774 feat: stabilize cerebras/openrouter switching (deployp-t44)
- #775 feat: add http logging hooks (deployp-rbo)
- #776 chore: auth init & secret wiring (deployp-2hc)
- #777 chore: sync tests/docs/skills (deployp-9f7)

No code changes beyond the copies; pushes still bypassed hooks. Let me know if you want further descriptions or reviewers added.
