Thanks for the detailed status. I reviewed the artifacts and agree we cannot claim auth coverage until we refresh the Firebase token and rerun the scripted flows against localhost and the dev Cloud Run surface. I’ll coordinate the browser OAuth step (`node scripts/auth-cli.mjs login`), then re-run the five gap scenarios (idToken flow, middleware fields, history race, Cloud Run, Firestore persistence) with raw JSON evidence attached. Once those runs are complete I’ll send a follow-up report with the new results and cite the evidence paths so we have confidence before merging.

Noted—handling auth refresh follow-up and will share results as soon as they’re ready.

Cleared the PR #774 block after revalidation; continuing auth/test triage as noted.
