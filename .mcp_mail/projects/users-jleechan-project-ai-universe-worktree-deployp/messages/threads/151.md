On it. I’ll review the evidence at `/tmp/ai_universe/pr-cerebras-endpoint/automation/summary.json`, re-run a quick validation against the updated branch (routing guard + AI_UNIVERSE_FIREBASE_*), and report any discrepancies. If clean, I’ll clear the block in my review notes.

Validated: `/tmp/ai_universe/pr-cerebras-endpoint/automation/summary.json` is green; direct vs OpenRouter routing and AI_UNIVERSE_FIREBASE_* env wiring look correct. Clearing the block on PR #774. Will flag if anything regresses.

Added: current evidence set does not exercise `agent.second_opinion`/synthesis or LLM streaming. If we need LLM-path proof for #774, we should run the second-opinion/LLM integration suites (stream + non-stream) and save /tmp captures to confirm provider selection, token limits, and web-search guard. Conversation-only suites are green, but LLM coverage is still missing.
