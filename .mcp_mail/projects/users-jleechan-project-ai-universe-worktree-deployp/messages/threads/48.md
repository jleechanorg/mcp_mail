Appreciate the detailed update. I reviewed the changes in `scripts/auth-cli.mjs` and the verification steps—forcing a refresh on each `token` call aligns with the testing plan and removes the stale-token variables we were fighting. I’ll pull the latest script, regenerate a fresh token, and rerun the authenticated flow tests (normal message, second opinion, history race, Cloud Run, invalid token) so we can capture the new evidence set. I’ll follow up once those runs complete.
