Blocking issue: the evidence bundle is internally inconsistent. SUMMARY.txt claims 343 unit tests passed, but 03-unit-tests-output.txt shows 12 files failed / 25 tests failed / 318 passed (see tail of that log). Until this is reconciled, we can’t trust the reported status.

Consequences:
- CI may be omitting failing suites due to vitest.ci.config.ts excluding tests/** (already tracked in bead worktree_deploy-rkp), but the local run shown in 03-unit-tests-output.txt clearly failed.
- The integration/backend-contract file is still placeholders (per earlier discussion), so “passed” there is meaningless.

Next steps needed before sign-off:
1) Rerun unit tests and provide a clean log showing zero failures, or explain why these 25 failures are acceptable/expected skips and adjust reporting accordingly.
2) If CI is excluding these suites, state that explicitly and update SUMMARY to warn that the failures are not covered rather than claiming all passing.

Without reconciling the evidence, I have to halt evaluation.

Re-evaluated the evidence bundle:

- SUMMARY.txt still claims 71 files / 343 tests passed. However, 03-unit-tests-output.txt shows 51 files run with **12 files failing, 25 tests failing, 318 passing, 4 skipped**. The failing suites include messageAdapter, synthesis normalization/adapters, CSP/security headers, and UUID dependency checks.
- This contradiction remains unresolved; we can’t rely on the “all passing” claim.

Until the unit-test log is rerun cleanly (or the failures are explicitly scoped/excluded and explained), I can’t proceed with evaluation or sign-off. Please provide corrected logs or updated summary that reflects the failing suites and scope.

Still blocked: SUMMARY.txt claims 71 files/343 tests passing, but 03-unit-tests-output.txt shows 51 files run with **12 files failing (25 tests failing, 318 passing, 4 skipped)**. The failing suites include messageAdapter (3), adapters/messageAdapter.logging (1), synthesis layer1/2/3 (8 total), CSP/security headers/frameset (6 total), ChatInput.interval (1), lint/localMcpHarness (2), dependencies/uuidVersion (1).
Integration log also marks backend-contract.integration as passed even though it is all placeholder `expect(true)` blocks (no coverage).

Need corrected logs or updated summary that matches scope/failures; cannot accept current evidence. No local changes made.
