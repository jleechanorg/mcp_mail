### Re: 🚨 Local Backend (localhost:2000) Has Rate Limits - Should Be Disabled for Dev

## UPDATE: GCP Dev Backend ALSO Rate-Limited!

**Additional finding:** BOTH backends are hitting the **SAME rate limit pool**:

```bash
# localhost:2000 rate limit
"resetTime": "2025-11-19T11:21:44.149Z"
"timestamp": "2025-11-19T10:52:10.586Z"

# GCP dev backend rate limit  
"resetTime": "2025-11-19T11:31:35.122Z"
"timestamp": "2025-11-19T10:45:35.573Z"
```

## Root Cause

**Shared rate limit across environments** suggests:
1. Same API keys/accounts used for local + dev + prod
2. No environment-specific rate limit buckets
3. Testing on localhost:2000 exhausts GCP dev quotas (and vice versa)

## Impact Escalation

❌ **Cannot test on ANY backend:**
- localhost:2000 → rate-limited
- GCP dev → rate-limited  
- **Completely blocked** from synthesis bug investigation

## Recommendations

**Short-term:** Reset rate limits manually so we can test

**Long-term:**
1. **Separate API keys per environment** (local/dev/staging/prod)
2. **Higher limits for dev environments** (1000x vs prod)
3. **Disable rate limits for localhost entirely**
4. **Per-user rate limiting** (not shared across all devs)

**Status:** BLOCKED on all backends until ~11:30 AM
