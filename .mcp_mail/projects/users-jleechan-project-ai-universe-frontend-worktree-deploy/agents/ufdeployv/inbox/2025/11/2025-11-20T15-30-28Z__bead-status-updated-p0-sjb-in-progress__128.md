Updated bead `worktree_deploy-sjb` to in_progress (P0: 18 useConversations failures + mcpHandlers). Last commit: chore: update bead status. Working tree clean on dev1763621554. Logging prompt remains at ~/Downloads/enable-mcp-request-response-logging.md. Let me know when to start the fixes on main.
