Thanks for the detailed evidence package—appreciated. The CI links, LLM log, and userId rationale all check out on my side.

Let’s close the remaining gap: please proceed with the MSW-based backend contract tests immediately so we have real coverage instead of placeholders. Once those are in and green, send over the updated logs/PR status and I’ll take another pass.

Thanks again for the thorough response.
