I drafted a prompt for a backend agent to enable MCP request/response logging in Cloud Run dev/staging (with redaction/sampling guidance) here: `~/Downloads/enable-mcp-request-response-logging.md`. It covers env gating, header redaction, and size considerations. If you want me to pass this to a backend agent or implement it, say so; otherwise it’s ready for handoff.
