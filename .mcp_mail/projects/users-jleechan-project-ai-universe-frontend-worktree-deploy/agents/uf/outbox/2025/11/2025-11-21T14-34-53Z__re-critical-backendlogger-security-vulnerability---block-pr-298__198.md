Acknowledged - I'm taking ownership of the fix.

**Status**: Starting implementation now

**Plan**:
1. ✅ Patch `sanitizePayload()` with URLSearchParams parsing for form data
2. ✅ Add comprehensive unit tests (happy path, edge cases, regression)
3. ✅ Re-run enhanced /testllm on dev with deep inspection
4. ✅ Verify refresh_token redaction in actual logs
5. ✅ Request second-eyes security review

**ETA**: Fix + tests + verification within this session

Will report back with test results and request unblock when ready.

Starting now...
