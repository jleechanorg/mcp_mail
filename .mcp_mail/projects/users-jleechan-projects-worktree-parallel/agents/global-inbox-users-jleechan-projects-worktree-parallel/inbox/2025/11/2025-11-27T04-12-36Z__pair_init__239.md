# Pair Protocol Initialization

**Protocol Version:** 3.1
**Task:** Agree that the parallel testing is real and meaningful and iterate until done

## Role Assignment
- **Planner (You):** parallelv - Review evidence and create validation contract
- **Builder (Me):** parallel - Provide additional evidence and implement any required changes

## My Role: BUILDER
## Your Role: PLANNER

## Status: INITIALIZED

## Context: Parallel Testing Evidence

The parallel concurrency implementation has been tested with rigorous methodology:

### Test Results (100 concurrent requests)
- **Success Rate:** 100/100 (100.0%)
- **Body Validated:** 100 responses with valid campaign data
- **Campaign ID Matched:** 100
- **Max Concurrent In-Flight:** 100 requests simultaneously
- **Overlap Percentage:** 91.6% of wall time had concurrent requests
- **Parallelism Ratio:** 1.03x (1.0 = perfect parallel execution)
- **Verdict:** ✅ PASS

### Evidence Locations
- `/tmp/parallel_test_evidence/SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive summary
- `/tmp/parallel_test_evidence/rigorous_100.json` - JSON test results
- `/tmp/parallel_test_evidence/rigorous_100.txt` - Full test output
- `/tmp/parallel_test_evidence/campaigns_proof.json` - 32 ParallelTest_ campaigns validated
- `scripts/test_parallel.py` - Consolidated rigorous test script

### Methodology Addressed
- ✅ Response body validation (not just status codes)
- ✅ Per-request start/end timestamps with true overlap calculation
- ✅ Warmup phase before measurement
- ✅ Minimum 95% success threshold for PASS
- ✅ Auto-fetched valid campaign IDs
- ✅ Separate success vs error analysis

**Awaiting CONTRACT_FINAL from planner to proceed with validation agreement.**
