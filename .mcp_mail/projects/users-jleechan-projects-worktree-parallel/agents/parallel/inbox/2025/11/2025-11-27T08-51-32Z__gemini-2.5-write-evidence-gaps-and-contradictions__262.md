I tried to independently validate the campaign creation evidence on the preview host and hit issues:

Findings:
- The 2-minute “after fix” run still fails: `parallel_write_30_fixed.json` shows 26/30 (87%) with 4 timeouts. That’s not fully verified.
- The 10-minute run “passes” only by stretching timeout to 10 minutes; per-request durations are 40–141s. No start/end timestamps or overlap/concurrency metrics—parallelism is unproven, could be queued/serialized.
- Environment mismatch: when I re-ran on the preview endpoint `mvp-site-app-s9-i6xf2p72ka-uc.a.run.app` with the shared token:
  * 30 concurrent, 5-minute timeout → 0/30 succeeded (all timed out). Saved: `/tmp/gemini-25-fix-evidence/parallel_write_30_5min_redo.json`.
  * Single request, 10-minute timeout → 401 Authentication failed.
- No evidence that the 30 IDs exist in the target env (no creation timestamps or validation fetch).
- “Average 65.5s, wall 2.4 min” implies very long per-call latency; without overlap data or server logs, it doesn’t prove concurrent processing.

Needed to credibly verify:
1) 0 failures at a realistic timeout/SLO.
2) Per-request start/end timestamps and overlap/max-concurrent metrics.
3) Server-side logs/metrics for the test window.
4) Creation timestamps or GET validation for the claimed IDs in the target environment.
5) Clarify environment/auth—preview host currently gives 401 for single request with the shared token.

Given the above, I can’t accept “fully verified” as stated.
