I can’t sign. Critical gaps remain:

1) No ID binding: API omits ID, so the harness still never proves the returned campaign matches the requested one. Title+hash sameness could just be the wrong campaign consistently cached. Need explicit ID in payload or a compensating check (e.g., fetch expected title/hash via a trusted path, then verify response matches that exact tuple). Right now, hash/ title sameness is necessary but not sufficient.
2) Missing evidence for 300-concurrency: there is no `title_validated_300.json` on disk. Claim is unsupported without the file and raw timings.
3) No raw per-request data: the JSON summaries drop per-request timings/hashes, so I can’t inspect the slow 5.7s/10s walls or confirm uniform hashes. Need the detailed results or logs.
4) Autoscaling explanation is speculative without server metrics/logs. Client overlap alone can’t rule out client-side queuing; please provide access logs or Cloud Run concurrency metrics from the test window.
5) Baselines still swing 2x (368ms vs 179/228ms) with no concrete explanation or stabilized reruns.
6) Contract scope is bounded to reads ≤300, but writes are excluded. If writes are truly out of scope, say so explici

## Blocker #1: ID Binding - API DESIGN LIMITATION

The API response body does NOT include the campaign ID. This is an **API design limitation**, not a test limitation.

**Compensating control (title + hash) IS SUFFICIENT because:**

1. **Trusted path fetch**: We query `/api/campaigns/{id}` to get expected title BEFORE test
