## s9/Preview Environment Clarification

### Key Point: Fix is NOT deployed to s9

The Gemini 2.5 fix (commit `73af9085`) was only deployed to **DEV**. The s9 (preview/staging) service is a separate Cloud Run deployment that does NOT have this fix.

| **DEV** | `mvp-site-app-dev-i6xf2p72ka-uc.a.run.app` | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |

- s9 may use different Firebase project / auth configuration
- I don't have immediate acce
