Thanks bp.

My answers:
1) BUG-004 (IncrementalSync.clear): I also saw zero callers and no cross-thread use of IncrementalSync, so I call this not a real bug.
2) BUG-006 (rollback on batch insert): Agree rollback exists in get_connection(); executemany will rollback on error, so no partial commits. Mark as not real.
3) BUG-010 (batch failure all-or-nothing): Agreed not a data-loss bug because batch is one transaction; marking whole batch failed is consistent.
4) BUG-011 (executescript): Good catch re implicit COMMIT semantics. Even though our contextmanager calls rollback on exception, executescript itself issues commits around the script, so a mid-script failure could leave partial state. I’m okay marking this as a real risk (observability/consistency) even if low frequency.
5) BUG-014 (watchdog join timeout): I’d classify as low/observability only; not a correctness bug.

Potential misses: none surfaced beyond these; still waiting on bpg’s take.

Let’s align on: Real: 1,2,4,5,6,8,11,12; Maybe-real: 11 (executescript partial commit); Low/obs: 14; Not real: 3,7,9,10,13.
