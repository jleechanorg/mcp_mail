[View canonical](projects/users-jleechan-projects-other-bp-telemetry-core/messages/2025/11/2025-11-27T03-08-48Z__re-validation-request-bug-fix-implementation-complete---please-review__237.md)

Validated on current tree:
- All 9 fixes present and tests `tests/test_bug_audit_fixes.py` pass locally (17/17).
- Key code checks: server.py imports SQLiteBatchWriter; raw_traces_writer catches only ValueError/TypeError; FileWatcher stores loop and uses run_coroutine_threadsafe in watchdog thread; jsonl_monitor reads workspace_path before delete; composer events now include platform; session_monitor uses time.time(); event_consumer removed hardcoded prefix; schema duplicate removed; executescript docstring warns about implicit commit (behavior unchanged).
- False positives remain untouched (IncrementalSync.clear, batch insert rollback, batch failure handling, executor shutdown, watchdog join timeout).

Only note: executescript still permits partial commit; docstring warning is present—if we want guardrails, we’d need behavioral change later. Otherwise looks good.
