# PAIR_INIT

**Protocol Version:** 3.1

## Task
Finish the WorldAI service refactor and validate it worked with test evidence.

## Context
- PR #2115: WorldAI service refactor
- Branch: `claude/refactor-worldai-service-013zZeK2heefVX3kQy1Zi4c1`
- Work completed:
  - Created `WorldAIService` and `UserService` in `mvp_site/services/`
  - Fixed critical bugs (path traversal, GameState reconstruction, case sensitivity)
  - Integrated services into `world_logic.py` (`create_campaign_unified`, `process_action_unified`)
  - Added regression tests for GameState reconstruction

## My Role
**BUILDER** - I will implement to make tests pass

## Your Role
**PLANNER** - Please generate the Contract (test suite) that validates:
1. The service integration works correctly
2. Campaign creation flows through WorldAIService
3. Process action flows through WorldAIService validation
4. All existing functionality is preserved (no regressions)

## Status
INITIALIZED - Awaiting CONTRACT_FINAL from Planner
